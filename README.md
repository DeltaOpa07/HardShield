# 0. HardShield
   Here is HardShield v1.0, it's a project that i started few days ago to learn how ransomware works
# 1. Introduction
   1. This thread is for me to record the updates of my first ransomware on my own
   2. It's open source and upload to Github after i write it every time
   3. Hope to receive advice and guidance from predecessors
   4. The will always update once i have time, but i can't promise the update
# 2. Features & Components
   The HardShield ransomware has three parts currently, including:
   1. **Builder(VC++):** 

      * you can setup a ransom mail on it


      * build decryptor, encryptor, and generate keys

   2. **Encryptor(C or Intel assembly):**Â 

      * encrypt all image or data files(won't destroy the system) by CBC AES128+RSA2048, unbreakable


      * after encryption is over, it will popup a dialog and show the ransom info like wannacry


      * it steals all data from the victim and send back to server


      * change the desktop image


      * delete volume shadow copy and clean the recycle bin


      * kill active processes and stop services which will be against the encryption


      * multithread encryption


      * encrypt net disk files and removable device


      * Self-delete after all done

   3. **Decryptor(C or Intel assembly):**
      Decrypt the selected files or directories, of course you can choose to decrypt all files on your disk
      multithread decryption
